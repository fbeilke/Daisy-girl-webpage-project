            <p class="home-p">
             When I left college in 2014, I moved back in with my grandparents and felt severely depressed and lost. I thought maybe getting a dog would give me a sense of purpose, which my grandmother agreed to as long as it was a girl. In an effort to get out of the house one day, I went with my aunt Dawn to her family friend Isamar's house. While visiting, I find out they just so happened to have two adult dogs, both chihuahua-dachshund mixes, and two puppies left: one boy and one girl. I immediately fell in love with the 2 month old puppy they called Blanca, and Isamar's younger sister decided on the new name of Daisy.

            <p class="home-p">
             My name is Finn and I am currently 30 years old. I am studying to be a software engineer through App Academy. I have a husband named Bodhi who is the love of my life, and we have been married since June 2018. We have no children, and our only pet is Daisy, who this year in 2023 is 9 years old.

            <h2 class="home-title">Who she is</h2>
            <p class="home-p">
             Daisy Girl is the silliest and happiest dog. She is blonde chihuahua-dachshund mix, lovingly called a 'chiweenie'. She loves to lay in her bed in the window and bark at passing dogs and deer from our yard. She also shakes her head back and forth and twists her body around when she gets very excited. We love Daisy Girl wiggles.
